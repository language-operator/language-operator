# Iterate

The user has requested to begin work on the top item in backlog.md.  This is a complex project that has been built by multiple agents, and be careful about assumptions.

Step 1: Interrogate.  Has the feature already been built yet?  Is the backlog incorrect?  It's very possible.

Step 2: Doubt.  What happens if we do nothing?  Is there an alternative or less disruptive approach?

Step 3: Plan.  With these thoughts in mind, begin to plan the implementation of the top item in the backlog.
