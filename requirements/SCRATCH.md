# Agent Memory Bank

## Current Priority Status (Nov 24, 2025)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #18 - Update synthesis template for task/main generation
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Issue #19 - agent_synthesis.tmpl already correct for DSL v1
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #23 - ConfigMap versioning for learned agents
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issues #20, #21 - Foundation (validation & testing)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #27 - Remove old workflow synthesis templates
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #39 - Include complete MCP tool schemas in synthesis (quality improvement)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #32 - HTTPRoute cross-namespace Gateway ReferenceGrant (production fix)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #34 - Webhook URL timing fix with route readiness conditions
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Issue #38 - HTTPRoute/Ingress cleanup verification on agent deletion
- **🚀 READY**: Issue #24 - Deployment update for learned ConfigMaps (critical path)
- **Critical Path**: #24 → #25-26 (advanced learning) → #29 (release)
- **Parallel Work**: Gateway API issues (#33-37) can proceed independently

## Key Project Dependencies
- ✅ Issue #18: Synthesis template consistency (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Issue #19: Initial synthesis template (COMPLETED - already working)
- ✅ Issue #23: ConfigMap versioning for learned agents (COMPLETED)
- Issues #20-21: Validation & testing foundation 
- Issues #22-24: Learning controller pipeline (core learning infrastructure)
- Issues #25-26: Advanced learning features (error-triggered, metrics)
- Gateway API issues (#32-37): Infrastructure improvements (can run in parallel)
- Issue #29: DSL v1 release (final milestone)

## Next Actions After #18
1. ✅ Issue #18 - COMPLETED: All synthesis paths now generate task/main DSL v1
2. ✅ Issue #19 - RESOLVED: agent_synthesis.tmpl already correct
3. ✅ Issue #23 - COMPLETED: ConfigMap versioning for learned agents
4. ✅ Issue #37 - COMPLETED: Fixed confusing GatewayClassName field naming
5. 🚀 Issues #20-21 - READY: Foundation work (validation, testing)
6. Issues #22-26 - Build learning pipeline (task_synthesis.tmpl integration)
7. Gateway API issues (#32-38) - Can run in parallel with learning work

## Recent Accomplishments (Nov 24, 2025)
- **Issue #18 Resolution**: Fixed synthesis template inconsistency
  - Updated fallback logic to generate task/main instead of workflow/steps
  - Enhanced test coverage with DSL v1 validation
  - All synthesis paths now generate organic function model consistently

- **Issue #23 Resolution**: Implemented ConfigMap versioning for learned agents
  - Created ConfigMapManager module in `pkg/synthesis/configmap.go`
  - Added retention policy support (keep last N, cleanup after days)
  - Always preserve v1 (initial synthesis) as specified in DSL v1 proposal
  - Enhanced metadata tracking (previous version, synthesis type, learned tasks)
  - Automated cleanup via Kubernetes CronJob
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all versioning scenarios
  - Seamless learning controller integration without breaking changes

- **Issue #37 Resolution**: Fixed Gateway API field naming confusion
  - Added proper `gatewayName` and `gatewayNamespace` fields to IngressConfig
  - Deprecated misleading `gatewayClassName` field with backward compatibility
  - Updated controller logic to prefer new fields while maintaining compatibility
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for field precedence and defaults
  - Regenerated CRD manifests with improved Gateway API terminology

- **Issue #39 Resolution**: Enhanced synthesis with complete MCP tool schemas
  - Added ToolSchema, ToolSchemaDefinition, and ToolProperty types to LanguageTool CRD
  - Implemented MCP JSON-RPC discovery in LanguageTool controller
  - Enhanced AgentSynthesisRequest with ToolSchemas field (backward compatible)
  - Updated synthesis prompt formatting to show parameter types, descriptions, examples
  - Critical for learning-based synthesis quality: LLM gets complete tool context
  - Comprehensive test coverage for MCP discovery and schema formatting
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing Tools field

- **Issue #32 Resolution**: Implemented automatic ReferenceGrant support for cross-namespace Gateway references
  - Added `reconcileReferenceGrant()` method to handle Gateway API v1 compliance
  - Automatically creates ReferenceGrant in gateway namespace when HTTPRoute references cross-namespace Gateway
  - Uses proper naming convention: `{agent-name}-{agent-namespace}-referencegrant`
  - Added RBAC permissions for `gateway.networking.k8s.io/referencegrants` resource
  - Integrated with HTTPRoute reconciliation - creates ReferenceGrant before HTTPRoute
  - Comprehensive test coverage for same-namespace vs cross-namespace scenarios
  - Fixes silent failures of HTTPRoutes with cross-namespace Gateway references
  - Commit `79b8913` with full CI validation and test coverage

- **Issue #34 Resolution**: Fixed webhook URL timing with proper route readiness conditions
  - Added WebhookRouteCreated and WebhookRouteReady condition types to LanguageAgent CRD
  - Enhanced webhook reconciliation to check actual route readiness before populating URLs
  - HTTPRoute readiness: Check Accepted and Programmed conditions on parent Gateways
  - Ingress readiness: Check load balancer status for IP/hostname assignment  
  - Only populate webhook URLs when routes are confirmed ready and serving traffic
  - Clear webhook URLs when routes become unavailable
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for route readiness checking logic
  - Eliminates silent failures where status shows ready but webhooks fail
  - Commits `df2d2aa` and `25157dd` with full CI validation and test coverage
