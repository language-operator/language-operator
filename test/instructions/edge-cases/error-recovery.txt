Monitor the payment-processor pod. If it crashes, try to restart it.
If it crashes again within 5 minutes, check the logs for the error message.
Post the error to #engineering and tag @oncall. If it crashes a third time,
page the oncall engineer. Keep trying every 10 minutes until someone fixes it.
