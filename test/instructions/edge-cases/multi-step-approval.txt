When I forward you an expense report email, extract the total amount and
category. If it's under $500, approve it automatically and log to the
Expenses spreadsheet. If it's over $500, send a Slack message to my manager
asking for approval. Wait for their thumbs-up reply, then approve and log it.
If they say no, email the submitter explaining it was denied.
