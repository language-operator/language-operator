description: Extract invoice data from email attachments and log to spreadsheet
---

When I receive emails with invoices attached, extract the vendor name, amount,
date, and invoice number. Add each one as a row in my Accounts Payable
spreadsheet. Save a copy of the PDF to the invoices folder organized by month.
