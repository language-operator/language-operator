description: Automatic ticket triage and priority assignment

When new support tickets come in, read the description and classify the
severity based on our SLA policy. If it mentions "down", "error", "broken",
or "urgent", tag it as P1 and immediately notify #support-urgent. Otherwise
tag as P2 and assign to the next available agent in the rotation.
